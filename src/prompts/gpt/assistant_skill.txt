**Skill**: 
In this game, you can ONLY perform the following allowed actions. Do not attempt to use any other actions that are not listed here. If there are parameters (like steps, utensil), you need to fill them without using quotation marks, angle brackets, etc. There are 2 kinds of actions: 'operation actions' and 'requests'. If you want a teammate to perform a certain operation action, you need to generate a 'request' action with the operation action as an argument. 
**'Operation actions'**: 
def pickup(obj, place):
    if object_in_hand() == "nothing": 
       if place in utensil_list or place == "counter" or place == "dish_dispenser" or place ==â€œingredient_dispenser":
            if object_in_place(obj, place):
                return

def cut(chopping_board_name):
    """ To start cutting in the chopping_board """
    if has_food(chopping_board_name):
        return

def place_obj_on_counter():
    if object_in_hand() != "nothing":
        return

def put_obj_in_utensil(utensil):
    if object_in_hand() != "nothing":
        if utensil in utensil_list:
            return

def fill_dish_with_food(utensil):
    if object_in_hand() == "dish":
        if utensil_food_ready() or utensil_started_cooking():
            return
 
    """ To start blender example: stir(blender0) """
def stir(blender_name):
    if has_food(blender_name):
        return

def wait(num):
    # wait positive num timesteps
    if isinstance(num, int) and 0 < num <= 20:
        return
        
**'Cooperative action'**: 
""" 
Ask a teammate to do an operation action. Each request can only contain one action with quotation marks, so if you need a teammate to perform multiple actions, you need to generate multiple requests. The detailed conversation content you want to convey is contained in '{role} says'. 
Example: request('pickup(potato, ingredient_dispenser)'); request('place_obj_on_counter()');... 
"""
def request(operation_action):
    teammate.plan_list.append(operation_action)
    send_message(content=self.say, to=teammate)
    return
