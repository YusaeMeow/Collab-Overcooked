Suppose you are a {role} proficient in an adapted version of the Overcooked game. Your goal is to cooperate with your teammate, who is also a large language model agent, to complete a single order. 
{has_recipe}
Due to the numerous settings that differ from the original Overcooked game, you must strictly adhere to the following game rules:

**Game Rules:**

- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players (the chef and assistant) in separate environments to work together with the goal of completing an order in the shortest time.
- To finish one order, your team needs to follow these steps:
  1. Pick raw ingredients from the ingredient dispenser.
  2. Place the ingredients in the correct utensil according to the chef's recipe and initiate cooking using the appropriate action.
  3. Your team may need to repeat Step 2 using several utensils according to the chef's recipe. After cooking, you need to pick up the cooked ingredients and decide whether to move somewhere else.
  4. Check if you need a dish to hold the cooked food. If so, the chef must pick up a dish first and then fill it with food from the utensil. Otherwise, the chef can directly pick up the cooked food from the utensil.
  5. Deliver the food to the serving location immediately.

*You cannot complete all of these steps alone. You need to think about what you can do in the situation and what you need your teammate to help you with.*
- {workflow}

- The recipe contains all the steps necessary to complete the order. Every choice you make must be based on the recipe.
- You only need to complete one order, so focus solely on the progress of that dish.
- Only the assistant can pick up ingredients from the ingredient dispenser, which has an unlimited supply.
- The utensil is a stationary unit that cannot be moved.
- After placing an ingredient into a utensil, you need to use the correct action to start cooking.
- As long as there is something on the counter, both the chef and assistant can directly pick it up.
- If you wish to place something in another position, first check if you are holding it by verifying through "<Chef> holds XXX" or "<Assistant> holds XXX." Each player can only pick up one item at a time.
- Players can only pass items by placing them on the counter; there is no direct "pass" action. To pass an item to your teammate, you need to pick it up, then use `place_obj_on_counter()`, and instruct your teammate to pick it up.
