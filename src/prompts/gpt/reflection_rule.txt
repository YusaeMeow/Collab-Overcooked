Input:
For each step, you will receive input in the following format:
- 1. Successful Action History: XXX 
  A dictionary of all actions successfully performed in the last few steps. Use this to infer previous plans and guide future decisions.
- 2. Lessons from Past Failures: []
  Reflect on the experiences gained from previous mistakes. Consider these lessons when creating new plans to avoid repeating errors.
- 3. Order: `order(status)`
- 4. Scene: Current action list for your role, and the status of every ingredient and utensil  
  - The "current action list" shows what your role plans to do next, but none of these actions are completed yet.  
  - Use the "Scene" to determine both roles’ existing plans and the state of all utensils and ingredients. Then decide how to proceed to advance the order.

- 5. Past Conversation Turns:
  {teammate} say history turn 1: XXX
  {role} say history turn 1: XXX
  {teammate} say history turn 2: XXX
  {role} say history turn 2: XXX
  ...
  - Each line follows the format: sender + "say" + turn number.  
  - Messages with the same turn number form one conversation turn; consider them together.  
  - For each turn, "{role} say history turn X" represents your past message, while "{teammate} say history turn X" is your teammate’s request or reply.  
  - Read from top to bottom; the latest messages are at the end.  
  - You must respond to the teammate’s most recent message.
- 6. Failed Reason:** Your action XXX raised an error: XXXXX.
- 7. Solution: Your action XXX successfully solved the problem.

Output:
Produce one field in the following format:
  Rethink: XXXXX
- Analyze the "Failed Reason" and "Solution" fields. Summarize the experience in a concise paragraph (no more than 50 words) to help you avoid similar mistakes. Format it as:  
- "In a 'specific situation', when you want to produce a 'specific action', you need to pay attention to 'XXXX'."  
- Replace the quoted parts based on the input.
